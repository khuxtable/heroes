# heroes
This is a very basic Angular/PrimeNG project based on the Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial.
It is paired with a Spring Boot REST/JPA resources project which provides a backend data source for the heroes,
backed by an Apache Derby database.

I will improve this readme in the next few days, really I will.
