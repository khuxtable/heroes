= heroes-createdb - a simple spring boot initializer for Tour of Heroes

This module can be run to create and initialize the Derby database.
If the database already exists, the data will be restored to the initial configuration.
The pom specifies Java 20, but it could be downgraded to Java 17. Spring 6
requires Java 17, so you can't use an earlier version.

The application uses an Apache Derby database, which it expects to find in your home directory
in the `.heroes/db` folder.

== Run the application

Enter the command:

[command]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
