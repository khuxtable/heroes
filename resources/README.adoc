= heroes-resource - a simple spring data REST client for Tour of Heroes

This simplified spring boot app provides a simple and not secure client for the Angular Tour
of Heroes tutorial. The pom specifies Java 20, but it could be downgraded to Java 17. Spring 6
requires Java 17, so you can't use an earlier version.

The application uses an Apache Derby database, which it expects to find in your home directory
in the `.heroes/db` folder.

== Create the database



== Run the application

Enter the command:

[command]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----
