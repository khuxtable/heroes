= heroes-resource - a simple spring data derby REST client for Tour of Heroes

This simplified spring boot app provides a simple and not secure client for the Angular Tour
of Heroes tutorial. The pom specifies Java 20, but it could be downgraded to Java 17. Spring 6
requires Java 17, so you can't use an earlier version.
