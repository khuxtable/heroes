This is a very simple Spring Data JPA jar providing persistence via an Apache Derby database.
The location of the database is specified in both the `resources` and the `createdb` applications.
It should probably be externalized.

Because this is so basic, I have hard-coded only two users, an admin and a non-admin user.
You can look in the `AuthService` class in the service module to see the username and password
for each.
