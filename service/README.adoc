= heroes-service

This is a very simple Spring Data JPA jar providing persistence via an Apache Derby database.
The location of the database is specified in both the `resources` and the `createdb` applications.
It should probably be externalized.

The initial data is populated in the `createdb` module via the `application.yml` file. See that
file for the initial users and passwords, and the initial heroes.
